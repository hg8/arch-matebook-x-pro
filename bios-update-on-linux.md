# BIOS updates

Huawei [provides](https://consumer.huawei.com/en/support/laptops/matebook-13/) downloadable BIOS updates packaged for Windows. With some effort, these can be installed from Linux.

To update BIOS, make sure `fwupd` is installed. You'll also need [firmware-packager](https://github.com/hughsie/fwupd/tree/master/contrib/firmware-packager) script and `gcab` that it depends on. I strongly advice having a bootable USB drive for bootloader recovery close at hand, too. Laptop should be on AC power for firmware updater to work.

**PLEASE read through all the steps before you start and make sure you have at least a vague understanding of the process! Don't hold me responsible if you trash your system or brick your BIOS!!!**

1. Download BIOS from Huawei website. Version 1.0.5 (we'll use it as an example) comes in a `.zip` file that contains a signature and another `.zip` file with the same name. You need that second `.zip` file, so extract it to the directory you have `firmware-packager` script in.

2.
        ./firmware-packager --firmware-name HuaweiBIOS --device-guid 4ab52f4e-04c0-47ec-af33-a4f5c28ce0b7 --developer-name Huawei --release-version 0.1.0.5 --exe ./MateBook_13_BIOS_1.05.zip --bin ./MateBook_13_BIOS_1.05/WRIWU105.bin --out bios.cab

3.
        fwupdmgr install bios.cab

4. Reboot (or hibernate) and hold F12 upon boot to select updater from list of devices. It reboots again during the process, so make sure to press F12 during the second reboot, too, for the process to continue.

5. Now your new BIOS is installed and you may check its version holding F2 during the next reboot. However, your UEFI boot record is likely messed up as the result of Step 4, so your system won't boot from SSD any longer.

6. Fix your bootloader using the bootable USB drive. I used a Debian Live image with persistence that had `grub-efi-amd64` and its dependencies pre-installed, so it was only a matter of mounting `/boot` and `/boot/efi` to `/mnt/system/` and issuing

        sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/system/boot --bootloader-id=debian --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/mnt/system/boot/efi

Your mileage may vary.
